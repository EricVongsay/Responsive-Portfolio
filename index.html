            <div class="aboutme">
                <p>Hello, My name is Eric Vongsay. I am currently a student to web development with the University of Washington. I believe the skills I learn in this coding bootcamp will help me find a career path I will enjoy as well as learning more about my own personal growth and development. Dedicating myself to this course while working and maintaining a healthy lifestyle will challenge me to become a successful individual that I plan to become.</p>

                <p>I love having fun and some of my hobbies include playing basketball, listening to Hip-Hop, weight-lifting, and playing video games. I also have an extremely energetic puppy named Bruiser. Bruiser is a one year old German Shepherd that will steal all of my socks if I spend to much time on the computer. I have also just started learning to produce and engineer Hip-Hop beats and enjoy self teaching myself the basics of playing the piano such as the different keys, chords in the keys, and the circle of fifths.</p>

                <p>This bio will change as I continue to build my portfolio and have more projects to talk about.</p>
